# VBA-challenge
  unfortunately will not be able to provide any screenshots as my excel continued to crash whenever the program ran, so very very unsure if it works at all
  the lines used in this code were derived from different areas of class activities, including but not limited to:
  - Lotto-AdvanceForLoops
  - CreditCardChecker-CellComparison
  - Census_Pt1
  - Census_Pt2
  - NextCells
  - ButtonClicks

  - # I wish myself goodlouck on this assignment since I actually can't see the finished product at all :')
